# This Is Jeopardy

This is a project provided by [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) in the Data Science track. 

In the Jupyter Notebook file (`This Is Jeopardy!.ipynb`), you will find the following:

- Basic exercises for the Pandas library in Python, i.e., mainly data frame manipulation and simple data exploration.
- Custom functions for finding trends over time in this data set and simple visualization of these trends.
- A simple text-based game in which you can play a modified version of Jeopardy! yourself, using the questions and answers in the database.
